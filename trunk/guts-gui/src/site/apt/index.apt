Introduction

	<<Guts-GUI>> is a light framework for rich GUI (Swing-based) applications,
	mainly based on the Swing Application Framework by Sun (JSR-296).
	
	It dramatically eases development of rich client applications based on Java
	Swing.
	
	Based on Sun's Reference Implementation of JSR-296, also known as 
	"{{{http://appframework.dev.java.net/}Swing Application Framework}}",
	<<Guts-GUI>> integrates at its core 
	{{{http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/}Guice}}, the Dependency Injection 
	library from Google.
	
	Complete documentation with code snippets is available directly in 
	<<Guts-GUI>> {{{apidocs/index.html}Javadoc}}.
	
	Additionally, source code comes with a sample Address Book application
	which sole purpose is to demonstrate normal <<Guts-GUI>> usage in a "real"
	application. This demo is available as part of the test source code, you can
	directly browse the demo source code {{{xref-test/index.html}here}}.
	
Building from source

	If you want to build <<Guts-GUI>> from source code, you will first need to
	have the following tools installed on your computer:
	
	*	Sun JDK 5.0 or later

	*	{{{http://maven.apache.org/}Apache Maven}} 2.0.10 or later version

	[]
	
	Basic knowledge of Maven is assumed in the following.
	
	#### setup source code dir, setup settings.xml, set up local repo, 
	building source, various patches applied (take either prepared jar or apply
	provided patch to source and rebuild dep)
	
Running the Address Book demo application

	#### Eclipse only!

#### Building your own application with Maven (repo, pom snippet...)
