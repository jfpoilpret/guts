Guice-GUI is a GUI framework based on Google Guice dependency injection library and the Swing Application Framework (JSR-296).

<h3>Guice GUI framework API roadmap</h3>
{@link net.sf.guice.gui.application} package contains the core classes to start a new application. As of version ${version}, there are 2 possible main classes to derive from in order to build your own application. You can choose to either build an application with a main frame (and possibly secondary frames) and put whatever you want in this main frame (MDI or SDI), or build a docking-based application with a single main frame containing dockable "views", allowing the end user to set the layout of views the way he wants. In both cases, the framework provides exception handling facilities (as described in section ####).
<p/>
In order to effectively use Guice-GUI framework, you'll have to know a little bit about Swing Application Framework upon which Guice-GUI is based.
In particular you will need to know about:
<ul>
	<li>Application lifecycle, in particular the following methods:
		{@link org.jdesktop.application.Application#startup()}, 
		{@link org.jdesktop.application.Application#ready()}, 
		{@link org.jdesktop.application.Application#shutdown()}. In addition,
		{@link org.jdesktop.application.Application$ExitListener}s are good to know.</li>
	<li>Resources management (internationalization), in particular the way component properties are to be declared in properties files in order to be automatically injected, and how those files are searched by the framework.</li>
	<li>Actions management: check the {@link org.jdesktop.application.Action @Action} annotation and its attributes.</li>
</ul>
The following links provide a good and quick introduction to Swing Application Framework:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://appframework.dev.java.net/intro/index.html">An Introduction to the Swing Application Framework API (JSR-296)</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/javase/swingappfr/">Using the Swing Application Framework (JSR 296)</a>: very good introduction article by John O'Conner</li>
	<li><a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/diverson/archive/2007/04/swing_applicati.html">Dean Iverson's tutorial</a></li>
</ul>
Moreover, you may take a look at <a href="http://jazoon.com/download/presentations/3360.pdf">this Jazoon'08 talk</a> for deeper coverage of Swing Application Framework based on real-life usage (part of Guice-GUI framework was developed for this presentation).
<p/>
Additionally, you need to have some basic knowledge about Guice Depedency Injection library (from Google) which is at the core of Guice-GUI framework. In particular, you need to understand the {@code @Inject} annotation and the notion of {@code Module}s.
The following links provide good startup material on Guice:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://crazybob.org/2007/06/introduction-to-guice-video-redux.html">Guice presentation by its authors</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://google-guice.googlecode.com/files/Guice%201.0%20User%27s%20Guide.pdf">Guice user's guide</a></li>
</ul>
<p/>
Besides, Guice-GUI provides several facilities as "services" (defined and accessed by their interface) that will help you:
<ul>
	<li>Manage your {@code @Action} methods easily</li>
	<li>Easily create menus and popups linked to {@code @Action} methods</li>
	<li>Easily create and display internationalized dialogs with a consistent look &amp; feel</li>
	<li>Create and show internationalized messages boxes</li>
</ul>
Plus, a few utility classes gathered in package {@link net.sf.guice.gui.util}.
<p/>
The following sections present more details on:
<ul>
	<li>Creating a new application (without docking)</li>
	<li>Creating a new docking-enabled application</li>
	<li>Creating dialogs and message boxes</li>
	<li>Useful extensions (3rd party open source libraries) to Guice-GUI</li>
</ul>
