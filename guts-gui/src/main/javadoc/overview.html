Guts-GUI is a GUI framework based on Google Guice dependency injection library and the Swing Application Framework (JSR-296).

<h3>Guts GUI framework API roadmap</h3>
{@link net.guts.gui.application} package contains the core classes to start a new application. As of version ${version}, there is only one possible main class to derive from in order to build your own application. For the time being, you can build an application with a main frame (and possibly secondary frames) and put whatever you want in this main frame (MDI or SDI). In the future, Guts-GUI will allow you to build a docking-based application with a single main frame containing dockable "views", allowing the end user to set the layout of views the way he wants. In any case, the framework provides exception handling facilities (as described in section ####).
<p/>
In order to effectively use Guts-GUI framework, you'll have to know a little bit about Swing Application Framework upon which Guts-GUI is based.
In particular you will need to know about:
<ul>
	<li>Application lifecycle, in particular the following methods:
		{@link org.jdesktop.application.Application#startup()}, 
		{@link org.jdesktop.application.Application#ready()}, 
		{@link org.jdesktop.application.Application#shutdown()}. In addition,
		{@link org.jdesktop.application.Application$ExitListener}s are good to know.</li>
	<li>Resources management (internationalization), in particular the way component properties are to be declared in properties files in order to be automatically injected, and how those files are searched by the framework.</li>
	<li>Actions management: check the {@link org.jdesktop.application.Action @Action} annotation and its attributes.</li>
</ul>
The following links provide a good and quick introduction to Swing Application Framework:
<ul>

	<li><a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/javase/swingappfr/">Using the Swing Application Framework (JSR 296)</a>: very good introduction article by John O'Conner</li>
	<li><a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/diverson/archive/2007/04/swing_applicati.html">Dean Iverson's tutorial</a></li>
</ul>
Moreover, you may take a look at <a href="http://jazoon.com/download/presentations/3360.pdf">this Jazoon'08 talk</a> for deeper coverage of Swing Application Framework based on real-life usage (part of Guts-GUI framework was developed for this presentation).
<p/>
Additionally, you need to have some basic knowledge about Guice Depedency Injection library (from Google) which is at the core of Guts-GUI framework. In particular, you need to understand the {@code @Inject} annotation and the notion of {@code Module}s.
The following links provide good startup material on Guice:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/">Guice presentation by one Guice committer</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://code.google.com/docreader/#p=google-guice">Guice user's guide</a></li>
</ul>
<p/>
Besides, Guts-GUI provides several facilities as "services" (defined and accessed by their interface) that will help you:
<ul>
	<li>Manage your {@code @Action} methods easily</li>
	<li>Easily create menus and popups linked to {@code @Action} methods</li>
	<li>Easily create and display internationalized dialogs with a consistent look &amp; feel</li>
	<li>Create and show internationalized messages boxes</li>
</ul>
Plus, a few utility classes gathered in package {@link net.guts.gui.util}.
<p/>
The following sections present more details on:
<ul>
	<li>Creating a new application (without docking)</li>
	<li>Creating dialogs and message boxes</li>
	<li>Useful extensions (3rd party open source libraries) to Guts-GUI</li>
</ul>
